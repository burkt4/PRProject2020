Task 5: Molecules

-Since the data set is of reasonable small size, and the data structure relatively complex,
we use a simple "homemade" KNN implementation.

-Regarding the cost matrix, GED, Cn and Ce:
Our GED is technicaly not a graph edit distance as we used a short cut for the edge Assignement Cost.
The intuition is that the structure of molecles is heavly influenced by the nature of the atoms.
For example: carbon tend to have between 2 and 4 neighbors while hydrogenes only one.
This means we do kind of a partial editing distances where we assign a cost for changing the nodes symbols,
and a litle adjustement based on the difference of edges.
As this is significantly simplier to implement, and produce good results, we consider this approch a success.

-Parameters optimization:
We splitted the train set in two subset, and tested the accuracy for given parameters (Cn, Ce, K).
As we observed multiple times an accuracy of 100%, and since this can be a sign of overfitting we decided to select
our best paramters based on the 2nd best accuracy observed during this phase; which is 0.994.
This accuracy is obtained by 13 combination of params. So we selected randomly one combination for the test:
c_n=1, c_e= 1, K= 3

-Results
This give us the following results on the validation set: 0.992 accuracy
